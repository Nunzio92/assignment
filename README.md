the structure of the project is the follow:
- `index.html`
- `assets` => only static resources like css or images,
- `styles` => contains all scss files,

Chunk of 6 cards will be loaded when carousel reach end, if the loading state is true 
is not possible to load more chunk until finish fetching. Set `hoverEffect:true` for
